<h2> What is Kotlin? </h2> 
<br><br>
<p>
Kotlin is designed to run on a Java Virtual Machine and can run side by side with Java. Although Kotlin first started as a language for Android development specifically, it quickly spread through the Java community because of its features and has since been used for many types of applications.

<h2> Problem statement for the project : </h2>
<br><br>
<p>
Due to online mode of teaching students face issue in concentrating to virtual sessions as there is less interaction between teacher and students. 
Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life and this can also help in solving this issue.

The app is under development, we are planning to add recyclerview for different core subjects for eg: engineering, we are also planning to add the profile for the user this will help in
